Design a high-converting homepage for a luxury custom home builder in the Macedon Ranges that follows the StoryBrand flow: clarify the problem, show the plan, position JD as the guide, call to action, outline stakes, show proof. UX design must match the style of the inspration reference (attached).

**We'd love to see your ideas on how to make this design exceptional.**

What to open:

1. Wireframe document: content order only. Do not follow its visual style.
2. Design inspiration link: follow that aesthetic direction, but use JD colours, logos and photos.
3. Brand assets: logo files, photos https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1sy5Ma0oliMbW-683_3ryOHfs0APWpeHN?usp=sharing

Brand and visual direction

• Positioning: luxury, calm confidence, craftsmanship.
• Colour: black, white, gold accents, neutral greys. Gold only as subtle highlight.
• Type: refined, readable. A clean sans with an elegant serif for headings is acceptable, but keep luxury without hurting readability.
• Imagery: natural light, material close-ups, real project photography (supplied)

Navigation and IA

Header: Home, Custom Homes, Process, Projects, Videos, About, Resources Hub, Connect.
Primary CTA in header: Book a Consult.
